# BoredBot - A Scrimba API Practice Project

BoredBot is a simple and fun web application that helps you find something to do when you're feeling bored. With a single click, it fetches a random activity suggestion from the [Bored API](https://apis.scrimba.com/bored/api/activity).

This project was built as part of the "Working with APIs" module on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). It served as a practical exercise to apply concepts related to fetching data from a third-party service and dynamically updating the DOM.

## Features

- **Get instant suggestions:** Click the button to get a new activity idea.
- **Dynamic UI:** The interface changes to a more "excited" state when a new activity is fetched, including a new background gradient and title change.
- **Accessible:** Built with accessibility in mind to be usable by everyone, including those who use assistive technologies.

## What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to put several key web development concepts into practice:

-   **JavaScript `fetch()` API:** Making requests to a third-party API to get data.
-   **Promises and `.then()`:** Handling asynchronous operations and processing the response from the API.
  

## Built With

-   HTML5
-   CSS3 
-   Vanilla JavaScript
